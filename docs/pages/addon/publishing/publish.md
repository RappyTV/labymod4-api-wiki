On this page, we're explaining what exactly you have to do to publish your addon. <br>
Before publishing, please make sure that you're following our <a href="/pages/addon/publishing/guidelines" target="_blank">Addon Store Guidelines</a>.

## Upload to GitHub or GitLab

In order to publish your addon, you have to provide us with your source code and an artifact (either built by GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD). <br>
While it is only necessary to publicly share your addon until we reviewed it, it is always welcome to see the source code of addons being publicly available at all times. <br> 

If you want to upload your addon to your own GitLab instance, write an email to <a href="mailto:info@labymod.net" target="_blank">info@labymod.net</a>.

## Publishing to the Addon Store

We use <a href="https://flintmc.net" target="_blank">FlintMC</a> as the back end (and web view) for our addon store. If you find any bugs, you can create a bug report on <a href="https://labymod.net/ideas#category=webbugs">our Idea platform</a>.

## Version Compatibility

We're using version ranges to verify the compatibility of an addon with LabyMod 4 and the Minecraft version the user is playing with. 

### The Star

The version `*` indicates compatibility with all versions (even unreleased ones).<br>
<b>Don't use the star unless you're only using version-independent things from the official LabyMod 4 Addon API.</b>

### Single Version 

Version `1.8.9` indicates compatibility with just Minecraft 1.8.9 and thus no other Minecraft version except Minecraft 1.8.9 will be supported. 

### Version Range

A version range is a range of versions supported. Contains [The Star](#the-star) and [Single Version](#single-version). <br>
A few examples: 

+ `1.17<1.19.2` - every version between 1.17.0 and 1.19.2 is supported - Everything below 1.17.0 (for example 1.16.5) or higher than 1.19.2 (for example 1.19.3) isn't.
+ `1.18.2<*` - every version after (and including) Minecraft 1.18.2 is supported. Every version below 1.18.2 isn't supported.

### Multi Version Range

A multi-version range is a combination of [Version Ranges](#version-range) and [Single Versions](#single-version). This is mostly used to guarantee a good experience when supporting multiple versions that have one or more major releases in between.
Example: <br>
`1.8.9,1.12.2,1.16.5<1.19.2` - this supports Minecraft 1.8.9, 1.12.2 and everything in between (and including) 1.16.5 and 1.19.2. Minecraft 1.9-1.12.1, 1.13-1.16.4 and everything higher than (and including) 1.19.3 would not be supported.
